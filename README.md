Machine learning models were created using 7 ML techniques to estimate the water quality of the Cauvery River data set. All of the algorithms were evaluated to see which one had the highest accuracy, and Xgboost ML algorithm won out.
Linear Regression: It's used for predicting continuous values based on independent variables. It works by finding the best-fitting line through the data points.

Logistic Regression: It's used for binary classification problems. It calculates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain category.

Decision Trees: These are tree-like structures where each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf represents the outcome. They're used for both classification and regression tasks.

Random Forest: It's an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes or the mean prediction of the individual trees.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): They're used for both classification and regression tasks. SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in high-dimensional space.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): It's a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm where the output is classified based on the majority vote of its neighbors, with the input being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors.

Neural Networks: Inspired by the structure of the human brain, neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data and produce output. They're highly flexible and capable of learning complex patterns.
